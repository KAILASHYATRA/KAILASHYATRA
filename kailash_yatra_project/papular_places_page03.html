                        <hr>
                        <p>The most puzzling destination of Kailash Manasarovar Yatra inculcating the sculpture of the
                            Sleeping Vishnu accompanied with an immense piousness..</p>

                            <strong> 
                                
                                The tallest sculpture of all time, the sleeping Vishnu carrying the utmost divinity…
                            
                            </strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>The highly devoted Yatra to reach the ultimate heavenly abode of the almighty Lord Shiva i.e.
                            the Mount Kailash is counted amongst the most difficult terrains of all times. But, its
                            results are undoubtedly fruitful. There is an existence of many important spiritual
                            destinations spotted in between the Kailash Manasarovar Yatra which have to be visited by
                            the devotees who are a participant in this Yatra. Moving forward with your journey without
                            paying homage to these spots shall lead to an incomplete Kailash Manasarovar Yatra, thus
                            visiting them is highly mandatory. One of the most favoured spiritual hubs during this
                            journey is the very famous Jal Narayan Vishnu Temple that is commonly known as the
                            Budhanilkantha Temple or sleeping Vishnu temple. It is the only Vishnu temple where Lord
                            Vishnu is found sleeping. The statue of the Hindu Lord Vishnu that has been established in
                            this temple is known as the very beautiful and the largest statue in the whole of Nepal and
                            is situated at around 10 kilometres from the Kathmandu’s centre at the Shivapuri Hill’s
                            base. Also, it is seen as a very puzzling one!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="facts-details">
                        <p>The tall sculpture of the Vishnu is having a length of approximately 5 meters and it is a
                            ‘Sleeping Vishnu’. It has been notified that the formation of this statue has been done with
                            the assistance of only a single block of the black basalt hailing from an unidentified
                            origin. The statue lies on a pond filled with abundant water in a reclining position
                            symbolizing the cosmic sea having a length of approximately 13 meters. The twisting coils
                            which are made with Shesha Naga considered to be a cosmic serpent are continually acting as
                            a support and a sheath to the resting statue of Lord Vishnu. In the statue, one shall
                            witness the unique posture of Lord Vishnu. The legs of Lord Vishnu are crossed and his head
                            is protected and sheltered by the eleven heads of the Shesha cradle. Having four hands, each
                            of his hands is holding a special object symbolizing some of his immensely divine qualities
                            and they are the club denoting the primeval knowledge, a lotus denoting the moving universe,
                            a chakra/disc denoting the mind as well as a conch-shell denoting the four elements.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="facts-details">
                        <p>Budhanilkantha is derived from two words i.e. Budha meaning ‘old’ and Nilkantha meaning ‘Blue
                            Throat’. But this name is presently known as a puzzling source and it is because the title
                            ‘Old Blue Throat’ has been undoubtedly given to Lord Shiva, but the reason behind its usage
                            to denote Lord Vishnu at this place still lies unresolved. The reason behind Lord Shiva
                            being called the ‘Nilkantha’ is connected with a fascinating story.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="facts-details">
                        <p>Some call it a myth while the others consider it as a reality. According to the tale, some
                            gods released some poison that was leading to the destruction of this world, seeing this
                            they started begging Shiva to save the world from this poison as a result of which Lord
                            Shiva drank all the poison as a result of which his throat started burning. He went up to
                            the northern part of the Kathmandu range, created the Gosainkund Lake through his trident
                            and lastly quenched his thirst. This had no side effects on him except the blue patch that
                            was left on his throat. Thus, he was named the ‘Budhanilkantha’. It is believed by the
                            devotees that the pond water on which the statue of Lord Shiva is kept in a sleeping
                            position belongs to the Gosainkund Lake. Also, as notified by the Shaivas, they have noticed
                            the formation of Lord Shiva’s reclining image underwater and that too especially during the
                            Shiva festival that is celebrated there with huge fervour in the month of August every year.
                            Apart from this, the locales also say that a mirror image of Lord Shiva is also created on
                            the underside of the Lord Vishnu’s black coloured statue.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="facts-details">
                        <p>It is highly noteworthy that there is the presence of the two examples of the Sleeping Vishnu
                            which are made up of the stone carvings in Kathmandu. But, they both differ in their
                            visibility. One is situated approximately at a distance of 5 kilometres from the Balaju
                            Gardens’ city centre whereas on the other hand, one may not be able to spot the other statue
                            as it is situated in the Royal Palace.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="facts-details">
                        <p>The origin of the Budhanilkantha’s statue is traced with two tales. Some believe the first
                            one while others believe the other one. According to some, the sculpture of Lord Vishnu was
                            brought to Kathmandu where it is currently located at the time of the 17th century when the
                            place was under the reign of Vishnugupta. On the other hand, some others believe that the
                            statue was spotted by a farmer and his wife at an unidentified place and the moment they hit
                            the sculpture, the blood started erupting from the ground. As a conclusion of this incident,
                            it was recovered and was at last put to the right position at the right place in Kathmandu.
                            However, irrespective of the place and time of the statue’s origin, it is undoubtedly
                            confirmed that for majority of the time during the ancient years, this was considered as a
                            reincarnation of Vishnu and this is because, there was the prevalence of Hinduism in Nepal
                            and they believed in Vaishnavism worldly known as the ‘Worshipping of Vishnu’. But at the
                            time of 13th and 14th century, Lord Shiva was the most popular and thus, the Budhanilkantha
                            was not so ardently worshipped. The origin of the Budhanilkantha’s statue is traced with two tales. Some believe the first
                            one while others believe the other one. According to some, the sculpture of Lord Vishnu was
                            brought to Kathmandu where it is currently located at the time of the 17th century when the

                            time of 13th and 14th century, Lord Shiva was the most popular and thus, the Budhanilkantha
                            was not so ardently worshipped.The origin of the Budhanilkantha’s statue is traced with two tales. Some believe the first
                            one while others believe the other one. According to some, the sculpture of Lord Vishnu was
                            brought to Kathmandu where it is currently located at the time of the 17th century when the
                            place was under the reign of Vishnugupta. On the other hand, some others believe that the
                            statue was spotted by a farmer and his wife at an unidentified place and the moment they hit
                            the sculpture, the blood started erupting from the ground. As a conclusion of this incident,
                            it was recovered and was at last put to the right position at the right place in Kathmandu.
                            However, irrespective of the place and time of the statue’s origin, it is undoubtedly
                            confirmed that for majority of the time during the ancient years, this was considered as a
                            reincarnation of Vishnu and this is because, there was the prevalence of Hinduism in Nepal
                            and they believed in Vaishnavism worldly known as the ‘Worshipping of Vishnu’. But at the
